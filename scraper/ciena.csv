As a core member of the High-Speed Photonics Operations group, the Photonics Components Program Manager role is a multi-faceted function encompassing vital internal engagement with R&D and product engineering groups as well as external facing into the Ciena supplier ecosystem. This role is fundamental to the successful evolution from product concept stage to full-fledged mass production phase. Ideal candidate has an innate ability to understand and bridge R&D program requirements into a ‘Production ready’ operations ecosystem while ensuring the entire product lifecycle management is well supported from product concept to sustaining production. Overall responsibilities of the role are divided as follows:

**NPI Program Operations liaison for R&D and Supplier ecosystem partners**

* Work closely with the R&D organization to ensure early and successful engagement with either existing or new suppliers to support Ciena’s plan of record (POR). This includes various responsibilities as outlined below:

**Product definition:**

* Be the ‘one neck to grab’ interface between R&D and new suppliers to enable a new supplier product development program, jointly with R&D. Key activities entail understanding and defining project deliverables and cost, construct of a SOW, ability to negotiate a development agreement and run weekly joint calls to discuss both technical and commercial issues.
* Ensure R&D demands for protos are understood and fulfilled by new or existing suppliers to meet Ciena’s Plan of Record. This requires close supplier collaboration via established working cadences with required parties to ensure all actions relating to early supply and commercial/ technical requirements are understood and dealt with efficiently.
* Ensure suppliers understand product objectives. Drive them to meet requirements for cost, output, capacity, quality, and weekly reporting expectations.
* Suppliers landscape could entail OEM suppliers, foundries, test equipment partners and/or EMS partners.

**Ramp preparation:**

* While ensuring the establishment of a robust supply chain and partner selection, this role also ensures that the operations ‘lens’ is a key factor for all decision criteria. Topics such as cost, BOM churn, product yield, test methods and coverage, factory capacity, supplier qualification, are all critical elements in the program development. Candidate must have a good understanding of operations elements to drive the right internal and external discussions with key stakeholders and partners.
* Define and communicate all elements required for Pilot and ramp; run regular cadence reviews pre pilot to steer the team to attain goals for a successful Pilot run.

* **Steady state production:**
* Facilitate weekly calls with core supplier partners to ensure successful product execution for KPIs such as cost, yields, output, capacity, quality, supply assurance, forecast compliance etc.
* Ensure any yield and quality issues are addressed in a timely manner through the engagement of the Product Engineering team or R&D as appropriate.
* Be able to translate detailed technical problems or opportunities into terms such as cost and schedule impact that are understood by senior management.

**Global Commodity Manager for EMS partners and Tier 1 component vendors**

* Given the direct dependencies of NPI program success with supplier execution, as a key member within the Operations team, managing a portfolio of critical commodities/supplier is expected. Key functions include:
	+ Pricing and contract negotiations where necessary to achieve Ciena total cost of ownership objectives.
	+ For supply assurance and cost competitiveness reasons, work with product engineering group to identify 2nd sourcing opportunities for key components/commodities. Work with EMS partner to establish a phase in timeline for 2nd source introduction.
	+ Understand global spend by supplier and ensure supply chain is well balanced.
	+ Establish operating cadences (weekly, monthly quarterly) as well as KPIs with vendors (component and EMS) to ensure best in class support and performance.
