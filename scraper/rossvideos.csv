We have a great group of people working together to create and deliver cutting edge products that look amazing and are easy to use. We go all out so that our customers can have the best possible experience and achieve quality results. With a product focus, continual learning, results driven processes, and creative thinking, we constantly strive to improve our solutions and to deliver results in a way that’s fun and respectful to both ourselves and our customers.
  
  

Ross Video, recently recognized as one of Canada’s top 100 companies by MediaCorp is seeking exceptionally talented and motivated professionals to join our Enterprise Management team.
  
Winning a top 100 award is not easy, it requires excellence in multiple dimensions:
  
* Work Environment
* Compensation and Benefits
* Family Friendly Policies
* Employee Engagement
* Training and Development
* Community engagement


If that resonates, and you’re someone with integrity, intelligence, and a strong drive to deliver great products, we’d love to hear from you.
  
  

**What's the job all about:**  

We are able to delight our customers with our innovative products because they work better when combined with other Ross products. For example, our production switchers seamlessly integrate with our graphics and replay systems. This is no accident but the result of a sustained commitment to developing our Enterprise Management solutions: DashBoard and Ross Platform Manager. Together, these form the backbone that enables Ross Video to deliver offerings with a 1 + 1 = 3 value proposition. By a conservative estimate around 65% of Ross Video revenues are enabled by the work of our Enterprise Management team.
  
DashBoard in particular is an industry leading facility control and monitoring system with the role of creating powerful and customizable user interfaces that combine the power of all of Ross’s technology. As a free and open platform, you will be serving tens of thousands of users by providing additional product offerings and enhancements and leading the technical direction.
  
As the Principal Technical Lead, you are the technical leader for your product or products. You plan and oversee the development of solutions to allow our customers to achieve or exceed their business goals. In this technical role you are responsible and accountable for the implementation and quality of the products under your purview. You craft the architecture and design of your product to meet product goals in alignment with the practices and principals of our Senior Software Architects and Technical Director; you oversee the implementation to ensure architectural and code consistency; you ensure that best practices are being employed, all the while making certain that quality and security are primary considerations.
  
You coach, mentor, guide, and help nurture the development team (developers and testers) to realize its full potential and adopt our culture of technical excellence and continuous improvement.
  
Should you join this team, you’ll become a key part of ensuring that Ross Video’s secret to success continues to enable innovations across all our product lines. You’ll also work with some of the latest development technologies and information security disciplines.
  
  

**Who you are:**  

It would be great if you already have expertise in live production.
  
You’re passionate about working in Java, and you want to raise the level of excellence of the team both in Java and across the various development tools and framework, such as Eclipse/OSGi, Eclipse Rich Client Platform, Swing, SWT, Java Native Access, and OAuth2.0 to create powerful applications with eye-popping user interfaces.
  
You need to be able to capture the strategic direction of the product and apply your judgment to define the path forward to meet our customers’ needs. We want you to bring that excitement you crave for exploring new ideas to produce tangible results.
  
You need to love learning and progressing your skill set. That means you'll be comfortable talking about your weaknesses just as much as your strengths and working hard on improving will be a daily habit.
  
You love to experiment and be proactive in developing sound solutions. Being part of an R&D division means that you will help push the boundaries of our understanding through experimentation and exploration effectively driving innovation.
  
You are fluent in clean architectural design; are versed in Domain Driven Design concepts; you know and employ the SOLID principles of OO design. You know and espouse the value of test automation. You know how to debate passionately and make objective decisions.
  
We work in a very collaborative environment, and you enjoy mentoring the other members of the team to always do better. It is vital that you care more about delivering the result than exactly whose ideas achieved it.
  
That also means you'll need to be interested in the processes, constraints, and systems that help product designs flourish.
  
You also need 10+ years of experience (or an amazing display of design and coding maturity if you have less than that).
  
  

WHY WORK FOR ROSS VIDEO?
  
Because we can help you flourish. You will get to develop and deliver cutting edge technological solutions for the entertainment industry. You will be part of the Ross Video team working together to make that happen, and we find that a pretty energizing environment to be a part of.

To achieve this, you will need to competently present and demonstrate our products to potential new customers and assist in converting them into clients. You will also seek to develop opportunities with existing clients by updating them on new features or discussing some of their requirements that may require new functionality or different workflows. Sharing other collaterals such as product documentation or new releases will be essential to that extent.

You will also be involved with post-sales activities as this role also includes assisting Ross customers with on-boarding activities (especially for first-time users), workflow consultancy and feedback gathering following the launch of Piero for a sports match or season.

Developing and maintain relationships with industry partners is also a key part of the role which may at times require a technical or workflow discussion which the development will assist you with.

It is also expected you will be providing feedback to development on existing or new features as a way to continuously improve our product. As a product expert, you will have a say in the product roadmap and go-to-market strategy by sharing critical information on market trends, customer requirements and competition.

You may also have to assist Ross staff with configuration support, thought leadership in the region, creating quotations in conjunction with the sales & technical solutions teams and providing support on tender responses.
In essence, the role will be about being product management’s eyes and ears on the ground in order to help grow the Piero business.

Who you are:
A thorough understanding of all types of our products in this space and their application is required, as is the ability to draw on experience to positively present Ross product features and performance against competitor products.

The Product Specialist will be required to travel extensively to support worldwide sales opportunities as well as attend Ross supported trade shows and events, therefore a valid Passport is required. Due to COVID travel restrictions, some of these activities may have to be conducted remotely.

• 5+ years of experience with broadcast equipment in pre or post-sales environment. Product management experience would be considered as asset.
• 5+ years of experience with sports analysis / telestration.
• Proficient in Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Visio
• Able to take complex technical details and convey the information to others in an easy-to-understand manner
• Excellent written and verbal communication skills (in English)
• Organized and very detail orientated
• Self-starter and quick learner with the ability to work under minimal supervision
• Able to work co-operatively with and across all company departments

Bonus points if you have:
• Experience in selling and marketing broadcast equipment
• Knowledge of graphics operational workflows
• Multi-lingual skills

We have a great group of people working together to create and deliver cutting edge products that look amazing and are easy to use. We go all out so that our customers can have the best possible experience and achieve quality results. With a product focus, continual learning, results driven processes, and creative thinking, we constantly strive to improve our solutions and to deliver results in a way that’s fun and respectful to both ourselves and our customers.

Ross Video, recently recognized as one of Canada’s top 100 companies by MediaCorp is seeking exceptionally talented and motivated professionals to join our Enterprise Management team.
Winning a top 100 award is not easy, it requires excellence in multiple dimensions:
• Work Environment
• Compensation and Benefits
• Family Friendly Policies
• Employee Engagement
• Training and Development
• Community engagement

If that resonates, and you’re someone with integrity, intelligence, and a strong drive to deliver great products, we’d love to hear from you.

What's the job all about:
We are able to delight our customers with our innovative products because they work better when combined with other Ross products. For example, our production switchers seamlessly integrate with our graphics and replay systems. This is no accident but the result of a sustained commitment to developing our Enterprise Management solutions: DashBoard and Ross Platform Manager. Together, these form the backbone that enables Ross Video to deliver offerings with a 1 + 1 = 3 value proposition. By a conservative estimate around 65% of Ross Video revenues are enabled by the work of our Enterprise Management team.
DashBoard in particular is an industry leading facility control and monitoring system with the role of creating powerful and customizable user interfaces that combine the power of all of Ross’s technology. As a free and open platform, you will be serving tens of thousands of users by providing additional product offerings and enhancements and leading the technical direction.
As the Principal Technical Lead, you are the technical leader for your product or products. You plan and oversee the development of solutions to allow our customers to achieve or exceed their business goals. In this technical role you are responsible and accountable for the implementation and quality of the products under your purview. You craft the architecture and design of your product to meet product goals in alignment with the practices and principals of our Senior Software Architects and Technical Director; you oversee the implementation to ensure architectural and code consistency; you ensure that best practices are being employed, all the while making certain that quality and security are primary considerations.
You coach, mentor, guide, and help nurture the development team (developers and testers) to realize its full potential and adopt our culture of technical excellence and continuous improvement.
Should you join this team, you’ll become a key part of ensuring that Ross Video’s secret to success continues to enable innovations across all our product lines. You’ll also work with some of the latest development technologies and information security disciplines.

Who you are:
It would be great if you already have expertise in live production.
You’re passionate about working in Java, and you want to raise the level of excellence of the team both in Java and across the various development tools and framework, such as Eclipse/OSGi, Eclipse Rich Client Platform, Swing, SWT, Java Native Access, and OAuth2.0 to create powerful applications with eye-popping user interfaces.
You need to be able to capture the strategic direction of the product and apply your judgment to define the path forward to meet our customers’ needs. We want you to bring that excitement you crave for exploring new ideas to produce tangible results.
You need to love learning and progressing your skill set. That means you'll be comfortable talking about your weaknesses just as much as your strengths and working hard on improving will be a daily habit.
You love to experiment and be proactive in developing sound solutions. Being part of an R&D division means that you will help push the boundaries of our understanding through experimentation and exploration effectively driving innovation.
You are fluent in clean architectural design; are versed in Domain Driven Design concepts; you know and employ the SOLID principles of OO design. You know and espouse the value of test automation. You know how to debate passionately and make objective decisions.
We work in a very collaborative environment, and you enjoy mentoring the other members of the team to always do better. It is vital that you care more about delivering the result than exactly whose ideas achieved it.
That also means you'll need to be interested in the processes, constraints, and systems that help product designs flourish.
You also need 10+ years of experience (or an amazing display of design and coding maturity if you have less than that).

WHY WORK FOR ROSS VIDEO?
Because we can help you flourish. You will get to develop and deliver cutting edge technological solutions for the entertainment industry. You will be part of the Ross Video team working together to make that happen, and we find that a pretty energizing environment to be a part of.

ROSS VIDEO THRIVES IN LIVE PRODUCTION, AND WE NEED YOUR HELP
We have a great group of people working together to create and deliver cutting edge products that look amazing and are easy to use. We go all out so that our customers can have the best possible experience and achieve quality results. With a product focus, continual learning, results driven processes, and creative thinking, we constantly strive to improve our solutions and to deliver results in a way that’s fun and respectful to both ourselves and our customers.
Ross Video, recently recognized as one of Canada’s top 100 companies by MediaCorp is seeking exceptionally talented and motivated professionals to join our Enterprise Management team.
Winning a top 100 award is not easy, it requires excellence in multiple dimensions:
• Work Environment
• Compensation and Benefits
• Family Friendly Policies
• Employee Engagement
• Training and Development
• Community engagement
If that resonates, and you’re someone with integrity, intelligence, and a strong drive to deliver great products, we’d love to hear from you.
WHAT'S IN THE JOB?
We are able to delight our customers with our innovative products because they work better when combined with other Ross products. For example, our production switchers seamlessly integrate with our graphics and replay systems. This is no accident but the result of a sustained commitment to developing our Enterprise Management solutions: DashBoard and Ross Platform Manager. Together, these form the backbone that enables Ross Video to deliver offerings with a 1 + 1 = 3 value proposition. By a conservative estimate around 65% of Ross Video revenues are enabled by the work of our Enterprise Management team.
The Ross Platform Manager in particular is a gateway to consolidating all Ross product solutions. Features you’ll work on include licensing, orchestration, role-based access control, and the migration of our existing solution to a modern framework, React. You will participate in an Agile team, working alongside your colleagues to design, develop and implement enterprise-grade solutions while employing software development best practices including the awareness and detection of code smells, inclusion of design patterns, and committing to delivering the highest quality solutions.
Should you join this team, you’ll become a key part of ensuring that Ross Video’s secret to success continues to enable innovations across all our product lines. You’ll also work with some of the latest development technologies and information security disciplines.
HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES?
It would be great if you already have expertise in live production.
Your focus on cloud technologies has enabled you to not only advise but lead the charge on cloudifying existing enterprise-grade products and building cloud-native solutions. You are experienced with one or more cloud computing platforms (i.e., AWS), infrastructure as code, and relevant cloud computing concepts in the realm of networking, security, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
You’re passionate about working in Java, and you want to raise the level of excellence of the team both in Java and across the various development tools and framework, such as Eclipse/OSGi, Eclipse Rich Client Platform, Swing, SWT, Java Native Access, and OAuth2.0 to create powerful applications with eye-popping user interfaces.
You need to be able to capture the strategic direction of the product and apply your judgment to define the path forward to meet our customers’ needs. We want you to bring that excitement you crave for exploring new ideas to produce tangible results.
You need to love learning and progressing your skill set. That means you'll be comfortable talking about your weaknesses just as much as your strengths and working hard on improving will be a daily habit.
You love to experiment and be proactive in developing sound solutions. Being part of an R&D division means that you will help push the boundaries of our understanding through experimentation and exploration effectively driving innovation.
We work in a very collaborative environment, and you enjoy mentoring the other members of the team to always do better. It is vital that you care more about delivering the result than exactly whose ideas achieved it.
That also means you'll need to be interested in the processes, constraints, and systems that help product designs flourish.
WE'RE GROWING FAST
That means we are always looking for better ways to adapt our work environment and processes to meet the high demands of our customers. Our roles morph, we volunteer for extra tasks, we all care a lot about helping good things happen. If you don't like change, you’re in the wrong place. But if you do, then you can be part of an incredible journey.
WHY WORK FOR ROSS VIDEO?
Because we can help you flourish. You will get to develop and deliver cutting edge technological solutions for the entertainment industry. You will be part of the Ross Video team working together to make that happen, and we find that a pretty energizing environment to be a part of.

Ross Video, recently recognized as one of Canada’s top 100 companies by MediaCorp is seeking exceptionally talented and motivated professionals to join our Enterprise Management team.

• Community engagement

If that resonates, and you’re someone with integrity, intelligence, and a strong drive to deliver great products, we’d love to hear from you.

WHAT'S IN THE JOB?
We are able to delight our customers with our innovative products because they work better when combined with other Ross products. For example, our production switchers seamlessly integrate with our graphics and replay systems. This is no accident but the result of a sustained commitment to developing our Enterprise Management solutions: DashBoard and Ross Platform Manager. Together, these form the backbone that enables Ross Video to deliver offerings with a 1 + 1 = 3 value proposition. By a conservative estimate around 65% of Ross Video revenues are enabled by the work of our Enterprise Management team.
DashBoard is an industry leading facility control and monitoring system with the role of creating powerful and customizable user interfaces that combine the power of all of Ross’s technology. As a free and open platform, you will be serving tens of thousands of users by providing additional product offerings and enhancements and leading the technical direction.
The Ross Platform Manager is a gateway to consolidating all Ross product solutions. Features you’ll work on include licensing, orchestration, role-based access control, DashBoard’s Custom Panel capabilities, and the migration of our existing solution to a modern framework, React.
Should you join this team, you’ll become a key part of ensuring that Ross Video’s secret to success continues to enable innovations across all our product lines. You’ll also work with some of the latest development technologies and information security disciplines. You will participate in an Agile team, working alongside your colleagues to design, develop and implement enterprise-grade solutions while employing software development best practices committing to delivering the highest quality solutions.
As the Product Verification Specialist, you are the last line of defense when it comes to delivering a product that meets our standards of excellence. You have a good understanding of testing at scale, performance, and software reliability and are knowledgeable of one or more scripting languages such Python or JavaScript. You are an advocate of test automation and are familiar with tools such as Selenium, Robot Framework, JMeter and Cucumber. With the desire and ability to reach out to other teams, visit customers and learn how software is used in a live video production environment, you excel at working and collaborating in a team setting with an open and collaborative communication style.
HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES?
You strive to develop a comprehensive test plan and test cases based on new product features, customer requirements or identified problems. Additionally, you develop integration tests in collaboration with other product teams to ensure interoperability and a smooth end-to-end workflow for end-users.
You are a team player! You support ongoing software development efforts which means participating in Agile based SDLC – requirements gathering, scoping, design, implementation, documentation, testing and maintenance, and are always in sync with your colleagues.
With a thirst for automation, you easily identify test scenarios that are critical and repetitive and effectively automate them.
Favoring organization and structure, you report bugs with quality descriptions and work closely with the development team to see through and verify fixes.
You need to love learning and progressing your skill set. That means you'll be comfortable talking about your weaknesses just as much as your strengths and working hard on improving will be a daily habit.
You also need 5+ years of experience (or an amazing display of design and testing maturity if you have less than that). And then there are the cultural requirements.
Bonus points if you have the following:
• Experience with live video production technology – if you have directed a live event, worked with a production switcher, operated a television camera or been in broadcast IT.
• Experience automating test cases (API level testing and user-level automation).
• Experience developing automated tests in a distributed environment.
• Experience in functional testing.
• Experience utilizing tools and scripts to test and optimize performance.
• Experience with Docker and VMWare.
• Deep knowledge of the various OS; Windows, Linux and MacOS.
• Intermediate Experience in Linux is an asset.
• Experience with Git is an asset.
• Ability and desire to travel – not a requirement for this role but the opportunity may present itself if you enjoy interacting with and learning from your end-users as a product expert.

WE'RE GROWING FAST
That means we are always looking for better ways to adapt our work environment and processes to meet the high demands of our customers. Our roles morph, we volunteer for extra tasks, we all care a lot about helping good things happen. If you don't like change, you’re in the wrong place. But if you do, then you can be part of an incredible journey.

We believe in technical excellence and want to create craftspeople as opposed to developers and testers.

What the job is all about:
• Architect solutions to satisfy project requirements

We are always looking for better ways to adapt our work environment and processes to meet the high demands of our customers. Our roles morph, we volunteer for extra tasks, we all care a lot about helping to make good things happen. If you don't like change, you’re in the wrong place, but if you do, then you can be part of an incredible journey.

Welcome to a very different kind of job posting. Why? Because social media should be fun and creative. So, we’ve decided that this posting should match the role.

As the Social Media Specialist at Ross Video, you will be responsible for creating compelling digital content across all social channels through an inclusive lens.

What does this mean? It’s corporate speak for, “Create awesome, fun, professional, and socially conscious content for the Ross Video social media channels that’s accessible and uses inclusive language”.

It means that we’re looking for that special someone who understands how social networks work, how to create compelling content for the audience, and takes the initiative to implement action through a socially conscious lens.

This role is based in Ottawa, Canada but open to North America and offers remote and flexible opportunity (after all, it’s a digital world now).

Who you report to: Director of Communications

What we offer:
Ross offers competitive salaries and comprehensive health plans, as well as several perks to help you perform at your best.
Some of these perks include flexible hours, generous paid time off, fitness/wellness allowance, employee share ownership program, professional development support and a ton of fun social activities and events!
Best of all, you will be part of the Ross Video team, and we’ve got a pretty energizing environment here.

What the job is all about:
• Be an online storytelling anchor for the Ross brand, ensuring our social content has a purpose and quality that people want to engage with and share (ie. Don’t just jump into a scheduling tool and throw a few, “because I have to” tweets out there. Have fun with it. Tell a story. Jump on different trends and try something creative.)
• The meat and potatoes: Create written, visual, and video content designed for news feeds and social-first audiences that’s inclusive and accessible. And have fun with it.
• Drive a strategic, data-driven social strategy across platforms (Is Marketing fun? Heck yes! And even though it’s fun, there should be a strategy and purpose to drive the platforms.)
• Integrate the social strategy into the marketing content calendar (And bonus, you get to collaborate with some great people ie. the ones writing this right now. Neat, eh?)
• Incorporate learnings from analytics into the development of content (I feel like this is the elementary school equivalent of saying, “Show your work”, or maybe we should say, “Use data to drive your work”)
• Collaborate with team members to ensure alignment on output. It’s important to work in a team with different viewpoints and backgrounds, this is what makes for great teams! You’ll play a key role in establishing what the unified output looks like to the world. (“With great power, comes with great responsibility #SpiderMan)

Who you are:
• Strong understanding of global politics, social issues, anti-racism, trans, and LGBTQ+ rights
• Uses and understands inclusive language
• Understands and can implement inclusive and accessible communication strategies. In marketing we often talk about our “target audience”, but it’s more than that. It’s about understanding that everybody communicates differently, receives information in different methods, and have different requirements to be able to consume information. Understanding this is an important part of the role
• Range (but not a requirement) of 3-5 years’ experience with:
• Writing and creative output
• Editing and creating content that is highly technical but still compelling
• Able to work with senior executives, engineers, product teams, marketing and business units, locally and internationally
• Comfortable using a content management system and scheduling tools
• Basic photo and video editing skills
• Understanding of different social trends and social media networks
